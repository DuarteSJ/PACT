/* sighandler.h — signal handling + crash marker for PACT runtime.
 *
 *
 * USAGE
 *
 *   1. Optionally set crash marker path before installing handlers:
 *        pact_signal_set_crash_marker_path("/path/to/marker");
 *
 *   2. Install handlers (call once during single-threaded startup):
 *        pact_signal_install_handlers(&g_pact->running);
 *      - SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGHUP: graceful shutdown (flips *running to false)
 *      - SIGSEGV/SIGABRT/SIGBUS/SIGILL/SIGFPE: write crash marker + re-raise
 *      - SIGPIPE: ignored
 *
 *   3. At clean exit, write the "ok" marker:
 *        pact_signal_write_clean_marker(received_signal);
 *
 *   4. Read the received-signal value (for shutdown-cause reporting):
 *        int sig = pact_signal_received();
